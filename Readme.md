# The project

We passed many hours to search a Knowledge base to fill all our needs, and after maybe 15 or more KB solutions tested, paid or free, open source or not even wiki
. We never found something that really rocks for us. That's why @decima took the lead to create from scratch a KB that will kill every kb out there.

## What is the perfect KB?

It must have the following features:

- A Good search engine
- A nice and modern interface for reading articles (you don't want to read something ugly, and you don't want people avoid reading your kb because it is ugly or unreadable)
- A good markdown editor
- A good markdown extensions for making diagram, styling, links and more
- A nice homepage for making thing accessible easily
- An easy way to import / export data from it
- A reliable way  way to store data by using a database and not just files
